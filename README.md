# PyBer-Analysis
# Overview
We were asked to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Having used Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

# Results 

Having analyzed our data we can clearly see that urban cities are the most profitable, and rural ones are the least profitable (no surprise here). 

It's also clear that peak times (peak times =peak fares) differ for each city type (however the end of February seems to be the busiest/most profitable time for all areas), the same applies to off-peak times - very different depending on location.


# Summary 
Based on our analysis we can come up with a few business recommendations:

*Increase the ammount of cars/drivers during peak time.
Considering that peak times differ from one city type to another, it has to be done: in the end of February, the very beginning of March in urban cities;the end of February in suburban cities and the end of February, the very beginning of April in rural municipalities. increasing the amount of cars/drivers might increase profits, seeing that the service is in high demand.

*Monitor the ammount of cars/drivers during off-peak times closely.
During off-peak times we might need to monitor the amount of cars/drivers and have the least amount possible, yet still sufficient to provide transportation. January and the end of February - urban cities; first half of March and first week of April in suburban areas; first week of January (almost no business), second week of February for rural cities.

*Possibly increase fares for urban areas.
We might consider slightly increasing fares for urban areas as they are potentially the most profitable based on the greatest demand. Even a slight increase will result in significant profits.
